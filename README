Assignment 1
2/4/13

I have successfully built the three pages requested along with two css stylesheets. I use the device width to determine which stylesheet to use. I couldn't quite get the sidebars to go all the way down using css, but I assume I am doing something wrong, or javascript would be much easier.

I spent about 2 hours on this assignment.
